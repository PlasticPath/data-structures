# Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It represents a collection of elements where elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top of the stack. Stacks are widely used in programming and computer science for various applications.

## Overview

In a stack, elements are added and removed from one end only, known as the top of the stack. The most recently added element is always at the top, and it is the first one to be removed. This ordering principle is known as Last-In-First-Out (LIFO). The stack data structure can be visualized as a vertical stack of items, similar to a stack of plates or a stack of books.

## Key Features

-   **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)**: The element that is added last is the first one to be removed.
-   **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
-   **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
-   **Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it.
-   **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
-   **Empty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
-   **Dynamic Size**: Stacks can dynamically grow and shrink as elements are added or removed.

## Operations

-   **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
-   **Pop**: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
-   **Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it from the stack.
-   **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
-   **Empty**: Checks if the stack is empty.

## Use Cases

Stacks have a wide range of applications in programming and computer science, including:

-   **Function Call Stack**: Stacks are used to manage function calls and their associated data.
-   **Expression Evaluation**: Stacks can be used to evaluate arithmetic expressions, infix to postfix conversion, and postfix expression evaluation.
-   **Backtracking**: Stacks are useful in backtracking algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS).
-   **Undo/Redo Operations**: Stacks can store the state of actions to support undo and redo functionality.
-   **Browser History**: Stacks can be used to store the history of visited web pages in a browser.
-   **Memory Management**: Stacks are essential for managing memory allocation and deallocation in programming languages.

## Implementation

Stacks can be implemented using various data structures, including arrays and linked lists. The choice of implementation depends on factors such as the expected size of the stack, the need for dynamic resizing, and the desired time complexity for stack operations.

## Conclusion

Stacks are fundamental data structures that follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. They provide efficient insertion and removal of elements from the top of the stack. Stacks are versatile and have various applications in programming, including function call management, expression evaluation, backtracking, and more. Understanding stacks and their operations can greatly help in solving problems that involve LIFO behavior and maintaining a stack of elements.
