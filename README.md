# Data Structures Overview in C++

This document provides an overview of various data structures commonly used in programming. It includes explanations, implementations, and examples to help you understand and utilize these concepts effectively.

## [Arrays](./arrays/README.md)

Arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store and access a collection of elements. They offer constant-time random access but have a fixed size. Arrays are widely used for various applications, such as storing data, implementing dynamic lists, and managing matrices.

## [Linked Lists](./linked-lists/README.md)

Linked lists are linear data structures composed of nodes that contain data and a reference to the next node. They provide efficient insertion and deletion operations but have slower random access compared to arrays. Linked lists are commonly used when the size of the data changes frequently or when memory allocation is a concern.

## [Stacks](./stacks/README.md)

Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. They support two main operations: push (add an element to the top) and pop (remove the top element). Stacks are useful for managing function calls, expression evaluation, and backtracking.

## [Queues](./queues/README.md)

Queues adhere to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. They support enqueue (add an element to the rear) and dequeue (remove an element from the front) operations. Queues are commonly used in scenarios involving scheduling, resource allocation, and breadth-first search.

## [Sets](./sets/README.md)

Sets are data structures that store a collection of unique elements with no particular order. They provide efficient membership tests and support operations like union, intersection, and difference. Sets are used for eliminating duplicates, checking for element existence, and solving mathematical problems.

## [Maps](./maps/README.md)

Maps, also known as dictionaries or associative arrays, store key-value pairs. They provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations based on the key. Maps are widely used for tasks like data indexing, caching, and solving problems that require mapping relationships between entities.

## [Hash Tables](./hash-tables/README.md)

Hash tables use a hash function to map keys to array indices, allowing efficient retrieval and storage of key-value pairs. They offer fast average-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. Hash tables are suitable for applications requiring fast key-based access, such as caching, databases, and symbol tables.

## [Trees](./trees/README.md)

Trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes connected by edges. They have a root node and can have child nodes, forming a branching structure. Trees are used for organizing hierarchical data, representing hierarchical relationships, and implementing efficient search and traversal algorithms.

## [Graphs](./graphs/README.md)

Graphs consist of a set of vertices and edges that connect the vertices. They are versatile data structures used to represent relationships between objects or entities. Graphs are essential for solving problems related to networks, social connections, optimization, and path finding.
